DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CREATIVE STATISTIC:

My goal of my creative statistic was to create a rather seemless yet interesting statistic relating all of the courses in the provided file together. By using "custom" as an argument in the command line, the program will output charts that include information about every room present in the given input file. The program will output all the courses in each room as well as the percentage of courses that that room hosts.



COMMENTS TO GRADER:
