MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:
Although I did utilize the gdb debugger at various points throughout the debugging 
process, I did not find it very helpful for many of the bugs I came across. I
included information about cases in which I used it in my report, however in most
cases, I did not need it in order to ammend the bugs.

Thank you for your time,
Samuel Marks
