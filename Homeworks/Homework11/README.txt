MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  

For the tables in the report, I attempted to get a good breakdown of the input sizes (number of strings), getting as close to 5 minutes for the operation time as I could.

My values put in my order table reflect the order notation of the functions that I have wrote.

Thank you for your time and consideration, as always.
